    "description_long": "Painted in 1889, Lady in the Moonlight portrays a solitary female figure seated by a riverbank, bathed in the ethereal glow of the moon, embodying quiet contemplation and timeless beauty. The woman, sometimes interpreted as a Yakshi from Indian folklore, is draped in a flowing sari adorned with pearls and ornaments that shimmer against the dark night, her posture graceful and introspective as she gazes into the distance, evoking a sense of longing or serenity. Raja Ravi Varma masterfully employs chiaroscuro to highlight the luminous effects of moonlight on her skin and attire, contrasting the cool blues and silvers of the night sky with the warm tones of her figure, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that blends European academic precision with Indian aesthetic sensibility. This oil on canvas work, housed at the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery in Mysore, Karnataka, exemplifies Varma's ability to infuse mythological and romantic themes with realistic detail and emotional depth, making it a celebrated piece in Indian art history that invites viewers into a world of subtle mystery and feminine poise.",
